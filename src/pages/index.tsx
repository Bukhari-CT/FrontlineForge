                  Since I was young, I've been fascinated by computers. I remember infecting my first computer with a
                  virus when I was only 4 or 5 years old üòÖ, and failing to install Windows. But that failure only
                  fueled my determination to learn more.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  As I got older, my love for computers grew stronger. I played games and dreamed of creating my own üéÆ.
                  It wasn't until I studied ICS in college that I learned programming and my interest skyrocketed. With
                  my professor's encouragement, I pursued BSCS at the University of Sargodha.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  During university, I developed websites and freelanced after taking a WordPress course. I joined
                  Pineal Software House to write code in WordPress. I worked on several FYPs, converting mockups into
                  fully functional websites.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Later, COVID hit and affected game development. I reached out to my mentor for guidance and deepened
                  my grip on JavaScript before working on React. I passed my first-ever job interview and started
                  working at Carbonteq, learning various skills such as clean code, MERN stack, and design systems.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  In my free time, I love playing e-games like Tekken, FIFA, CSGO, and Cricket 22 üéÆüèè. I'm a die-hard
                  cricket fan and even play cricket in my spare time. I also like to play snooker and go hiking to stay
                  updated with new trends and technologies.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Overall, my journey has been a mix of failures and successes, but my passion for computers has only
                  grown stronger with time. I dream of continuously learning new things, as it keeps me interested in
                  life and healthy. üí™
