  "From a young age, I've always been drawn to computers. I vividly remember the time when I was just 4 or 5 years old and injected my first virus into my computer. 😅 Of course, I had no idea how to fix it and ended up failing at my first attempt at installing Windows. But, that failure sparked my curiosity and determination to learn more./nAs I grew older, my love for computers only grew stronger. I started playing games and dreamt of creating my own games one day. 🎮 It wasn't until I started studying ICS in college that I learned the basics of programming, and my interest in it skyrocketed. My professor encouraged me to pursue it further, and that's when I decided to pursue BSCS at the University of Sargodha./n/nDuring my time in university, I honed my skills and started developing websites on my own. I even took a course in WordPress web development and started freelancing. I built several websites but realized that I wanted to write code in WordPress. That's when I joined Pineal software house, where I worked on several FYPs and converted mockups into fully functional websites./n/nAfter some time, a friend who was a game developer offered me a job at his office. I was thrilled to finally be working on my childhood dream, but then COVID hit, and our development was severely affected. I didn't want to sit idle, so I reached out to my elder brother and mentor for guidance. He suggested that I deepen my grip on JavaScript, and that's exactly what I did. I learned it thoroughly and then started working on React./n/nEventually, I completed my degree and applied for a job at Carbonteq. I was ecstatic to pass my first-ever interview and started working there. In my two years of experience, I learned various skills such as writing clean code, effective communication, MERN stack, SOLID pattern, 12 factor app, and design system, to name a few./n/nIn my free time, I love playing e-games, especially Tekken, FIFA, CSGO, and Cricket 22. 🎮🏏 I'm a die-hard cricket fan and even play cricket in my spare time. I also like to play snooker and go hiking to stay updated with new trends and technologies./n/nOverall, my journey has been a combination of failures and successes, but my passion for computers has only grown stronger with time.";
